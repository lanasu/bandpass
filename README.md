# bandpass

At a very basic level, this code pretty much draws exactly from Matlab and tries to translate it in a very simplistic way. I chose to do it this way because I actually have never used Matlab before and wanted to be very simple in my python coding. There were some little tricky things-- I had to make sure the arrays were formatted properly and that I wasn't trying to divide an integer by a tuple and things like that.

The plots also translate very simply from Matlab to Python. 

Goal 1 is, as expected, for Goal 1. 

Goal 2, to be honest, I'm not sure if it works because I had troubles getting Scipy on my laptop, but this is just what I might do to try and accomplish Goal 2.
